The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 19.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 95.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 15.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 100.4 hours of data, or 81.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 4.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (27,35.8,106)
