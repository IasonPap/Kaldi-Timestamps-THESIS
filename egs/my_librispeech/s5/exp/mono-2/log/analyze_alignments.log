The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 22.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 84.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 8.1% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.0 hours of data, or 1.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 2.5% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (20,27.7,82)
