The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 17.2% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 96.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 13.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 35.1 hours of data, or 29.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.9% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (25,33.8,102)
